# Simon-Says-Game
Simon Says game using LEDs and Arduino Uno

How to play:

Press the GREEN and RED LED buttons at the same time and release them to begin.

Simon (the board) will tell you what to do based on the LEDs lighting up - He adds one more order each time (this is randomized).

If you get all of the orders right you win the game, and all the LEDs will start flashing to celebrate (3 times).

If you don't and you mess up an order then ALL LEDS will flash once, and you have to start all over (by pressing the start buttons again).

Game time: 15 turns - can adjust in the code by changing GAMETIME variable at top of void loop().

Enjoy!
